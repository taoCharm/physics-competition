# physics-competition
A hydromechanics project by researching ping-pong
## Introduction
My school encouraged us to take part in the Physics Competition of B.S. So I coded this project in MATLAB.<br><br>
The project is to analyze Magnus force by using R-K method. In this way the program gets the numerical solutions of differential equations. They are the position of the ball to draw the  trajectory of it.
## Get started
#### Platform
- [x] Windows

I have created a GUI for the project. You can just click the ```run``` and then you can change the data inside the input box.
